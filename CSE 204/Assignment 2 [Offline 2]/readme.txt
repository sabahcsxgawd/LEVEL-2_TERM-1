StackADT.java --> It is the Stack Interface which's functions are implemented in ArrStack and LLStack java files.

ArrStack.java --> It is the Array Based Implementation based on the functions provided in the StackADT.

LLStack.java --> It is the LinkedList Based Implementation based on the functions provided in the StackADT.

main1.java --> It contains the main function where both of the Stack Data Structures are tested. Also there is a print method which prints the elements of the Stack.

DishWasher.java --> It is the implementation of DishWasher based on the implementation of ArrStack and LLStack. Here instead of build in Data Structures, custom implementation for Array and LinkedList and OneArrayTwoStack has been done based on the StackADT implementation.
